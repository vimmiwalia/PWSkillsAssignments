Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) /
(ii) %
(iii) //
(iv) **
"""

# Variables for calculations
a=2
b=200
c=3

# Example of operator '/'
# Usage: Division
temp1=b/c
print(temp1)

# Example of operator '%'
# Usage: Modulus
temp2=b%c
print(temp2)

# Example of operator '//'
# Usage: Floor Division. Which means rounds off the results down to nearest whole number

temp3=b//c
print(temp3)

# Example of operator '**'
# Usage: Exponention
temp4=c**a
print(temp4)



# Example of operator '//'
# Usage: Floor Division. Which means rounds off the results down to nearest whole number
